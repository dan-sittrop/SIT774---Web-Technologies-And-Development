            <p>
                Here are five popular cap styles along with brief descriptions:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Baseball Cap:</span>  <!-- inline style use of the .highlight class -->
                    The classic baseball cap features a rounded
                    crown and a stiff peak brim. It's versatile and suitable
                    for casual wear, sports, and outdoor activities. Baseball
                    caps often have adjustable straps at the back for a
                    customized fit.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Snapback Cap:</span> <!-- inline style use of the .highlight class -->
                    A snapback cap is characterized by its adjustable snap closure at the back, which allows for a
                    comfortable fit. It typically has a flat brim and a structured crown. Snapbacks are popular in
                    streetwear fashion and can feature various logos and designs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Trucker Cap:</span> <!-- inline style use of the .highlight class -->
                    Trucker caps have a distinctive mesh panel at the back, which provides ventilation. The front panels
                    are usually made of foam and may feature logos or designs. Originally worn by truck drivers, they
                    have become a trendy choice for casual and outdoor wear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Bucket Hat:</span> <!-- inline style use of the .highlight class -->
                    Bucket hats have a wide, downward-sloping brim and a soft, unstructured crown. They are made from
                    materials like cotton, denim, or nylon, offering sun protection and a laid-back style. Bucket hats
                    have gained popularity in streetwear and casual fashion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Beanie:</span> <!-- inline style use of the .highlight class -->
                    Unlike traditional caps, beanies are knitted or woven hats that fit snugly on the head. They are
                    typically made of wool, cotton, or acrylic, providing warmth and comfort. Beanies come in various
                    styles, including cuffed, slouchy, and pom-pom beanies, making them versatile for different looks
                    and seasons.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Each of these cap styles offers unique features and aesthetics,
                catering to different preferences and occasions. Whether you're
                into sports, streetwear, or simply looking to add a stylish
                accessory to your outfit, there's a cap style to match your taste.
